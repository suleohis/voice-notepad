## üìÑ Project Structure and Page Explanation

The Voice Notepad application is built as a Single Page Application (SPA) with a clear separation of concerns in its core files:

* `index.html`: This is the main and only HTML file for the application. It provides the basic structure for the voice input area and the display area for saved notes.
* `style.css`: Contains all the CSS rules that define the look and feel of the application, ensuring it's user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing across different devices.
* `script.js`: Houses the core JavaScript logic. This file handles:
    * Initializing and managing the Web Speech API.
    * Capturing voice input and transcribing it.
    * Saving, loading, and deleting notes from `localStorage`.
    * Dynamically updating the UI to display notes and provide user feedback.

### Main Application View

This is the primary interface where users can record new voice notes and see a list of their previously saved notes.

**What this page does:**

* **Record New Note:** Features a prominent "Start Recording" button. When clicked, the application listens to your voice and transcribes it in real-time.
* **Display Transcription:** As you speak, the transcribed text appears in a dedicated area, allowing you to see the conversion happening live.
* **Save/Clear Actions:** After recording, buttons appear to either "Save Note" (which adds it to your local storage) or "Clear" (to discard the current transcription).
* **List Existing Notes:** Below the recording area, a section displays all previously saved notes. Each note typically shows a snippet of its content and a "Delete" button.
